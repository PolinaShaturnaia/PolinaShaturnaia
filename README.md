**Hi there ðŸ‘‹**

In case you are wondering i'am currently open to new roles.
#opentowork #datascience #data-science

I have one year experience in data science, data processing, data analysis and machine learning, Python and SQL database languages, hypothesis testing, A/B testing, regression and classification modeling. I have knowledge in working with tabular, timeseries, graph data. I apply knowledge in the field of computer vision, linear algebra and statistical data analysis.

My main strength is the ability to build high-quality communications. The interests and needs of people are important to me. I am pragmatic yet curious and open to learning new ways of doing things.

Ready to start working.
Ready for relocation.

**Skills:**

â€¢	Python â€“ 1 year

â€¢	SQL â€“ 1 year

â€¢	Natural language processing:
  - Text vectorization
  - Text lemmatization
  - TF-IDF
  - Transfer learning, pretraining, finetuning BERT
  - Transformers
  - Language modeling, self-training
  - Regular expressions

â€¢	Machine learning:
  - Data wrangling, writing feature extraction pipelines
  - Supervised and unsupervised learning
  - Neural networks
  - Data exploration
  - Gradient boosting and ensemble algorithms
  - Model blending and stacking
  - Metric learning

â€¢	Computer vision:
  - Keras
  - Ð¡onvolutional neural network, CNN
  - LeNet
  - Adam algorithm
  - Augmentation

â€¢	ML libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, lightgbm, catboost, statsmodels

â€¢	DL libraries: pytorch, tensorflow, transformers
