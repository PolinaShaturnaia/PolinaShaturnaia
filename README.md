### Hi there 👋

In case you are wondering i'am currently open to new roles.
#opentowork #datascience #data-science

I have one year experience in data science, data processing, data analysis and machine learning, Python and SQL database languages, hypothesis testing, A/B testing, regression and classification modeling. I have knowledge in working with tabular, timeseries, graph data. I apply knowledge in the field of computer vision, linear algebra and statistical data analysis.

My main strength is the ability to build high-quality communications. The interests and needs of people are important to me. I am pragmatic yet curious and open to learning new ways of doing things.

Ready to start working.
Ready for relocation.
