### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In case you are wondering i'am currently open to new roles.
#opentowork #datascience #data-science

I have one year experience in data science, data processing, data analysis and machine learning, Python and SQL database languages, hypothesis testing, A/B testing, regression and classification modeling. I have knowledge in working with tabular, timeseries, graph data. I apply knowledge in the field of computer vision, linear algebra and statistical data analysis.

My main strength is the ability to build high-quality communications. The interests and needs of people are important to me. I am pragmatic yet curious and open to learning new ways of doing things.

Ready to start working.
Ready for relocation.

Skills:

â€¢	Python â€“ 1 year

â€¢	SQL â€“ 1 year

â€¢	Natural language processing:
  o	Text vectorization
  o	Text lemmatization
  o	TF-IDF
  o	Transfer learning, pretraining, finetuning BERT
  o	Transformers
  o	Language modeling, self-training
  o	Regular expressions
â€¢	Machine learning:
  o	Data wrangling, writing feature extraction pipelines
  o	Supervised and unsupervised learning
  o	Neural networks
  o	Data exploration
  o	Gradient boosting and ensemble algorithms
  o	Model blending and stacking
  o	Metric learning
â€¢	Computer vision:
  o	Keras
  o	Ð¡onvolutional neural network, CNN
  o	LeNet
  o	Adam algorithm
  o	Augmentation
â€¢	ML libraries: pandas, numpy, scipy, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, lightgbm, catboost, statsmodels
â€¢	DL libraries: pytorch, tensorflow, transformers

The projects are in the repository: https://github.com/PolinaShaturnaia/Data_Science_projects
| Project name | Description | Libraries used |
